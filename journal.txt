================================
Version: 1.0 - 2014-05-07
================================

R4H is a plugin for Hadoop Distributed FileSystem (HDFS) which accelerates HDFS by
using RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) technology as a parallel data path to the 
current TCP implementation. Currently R4H enables HDFS Write operations over RDMA
using Mellanox ConnectXÂ® interconnect for Ethernet and InfiniBand fabrics.

LIMITATIONS:

  Currently supports only Cloudera Hadoop (CDH) v4.4

KNOWN ISSUES:
  
  Unable to run jobs with more than 100 parallel files and over 1TB overall
