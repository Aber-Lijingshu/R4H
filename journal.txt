================================
Version: 1.2 - 2014-12-31
================================

CHANGES:
  
  Stability and failure handling improvments

  Task #425202 - Improved streamer's batch processing logic

  Task #449726 - Avoid allocating new IO thread on clean flow

  Task #449728 - Workers return to pool earlier, after sending last reply

FIXED:
  
  Bug #428539 - Client excludes all datanodes upon failure

  Bug #425912 - Large job fails due to absence of getAdditionalMsgPool callback

  Bug #425948 - No cleaning of async tasks submitted for IO thread on failure flow

  Bug #448205 - memory leak messages in Hive shell on exit when R4H is enabled

  Bug #431417 - Accelio resource leak on YARN's Application Master

  Bug #429514 - Different callbacks share the same client session

  Bug #424522 - User object leak on client side

  Bug #468918 - Header ack timeout on first request of 0.1% of new block sessions (Accelio bugs fix)

  
KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

  Not supported by applications which explicitly require org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DistributedFileSystem

    - HBase master fails to boot with R4H when HDFS is in safe mode
	Work around: wait for HDFS to leave safe mode and only then start Hbase
    
    - Impala

    - DFSAdmin

KNOWN ISSUES:

  Risk of unexpected behavior for applications that fork after allocating JXIO/Accelio/RDMA resources, though such applications were not observed

================================
Version: 1.0 - 2014-05-07
================================

R4H is a plugin for Hadoop Distributed FileSystem (HDFS) which accelerates HDFS by
using RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) technology as a parallel data path to the 
current TCP implementation. Currently R4H enables HDFS Write operations over RDMA
using Mellanox ConnectXÂ® interconnect for Ethernet and InfiniBand fabrics.

LIMITATIONS:

  Currently supports only Cloudera Hadoop (CDH) v4.4

KNOWN ISSUES:
  
  Unable to run jobs with more than 100 parallel files and over 1TB overall
